h1. Fusebox

A super-lightweight lightbox-esque jQuery plugin (with jQuery UI support)

h2. Why?

"Facebox":http://github.com/defunkt/facebox wasn't carrying over my event bindings and was oftentimes too heavy.  The idea here is to keep it braindead simple.

h2. Caveats!

It only supports inline content because that's all I ever really need.  This may eventually support images, but we'll see.  If it does, it won't be for slideshows or anything complex; just a bigger version of whatever the user clicked on.

h2. Ways and Means

It -uses- +requires+ jQuery 1.3.2 (well, not now, but eventually) due to jQuery's awesome @live@ function.

h2. Complaints, Problems, or Ideas?

If there's a problem, let me know.  If it's a feature request, most likely I won't code for it unless I've actually needed it myself.  If there's a legitimate way to improve the library (whether it be a better write Javascript or a better usage of what jQuery has to offer), *definitely* let me know.  I'm not really a Javascript hacker, so there are bound to be improvements just itching to get written.
